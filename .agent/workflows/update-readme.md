description: update readme after finishing each feature task
---

// turbo-all

After completing any feature task (e.g. a new Phase, new agent, new API, new UI feature), update the project README.md to reflect the changes.

## Steps

1. Review what was just completed — new features, new files, changed behavior.

2. Update `d:\AI_TEAM\ai-devops-guardian\README.md`:
   - Update the **Phase** badge and **Roadmap** section (mark newly completed items ✅)
   - Add any new features to the relevant Features table or section
   - Update **Project Structure** if new files/folders were added
   - Update **API Reference** if new endpoints were created
   - Update the **Architecture** diagram if the data flow changed
   - Update the closing tagline (bottom of file) to reflect the latest phase

3. Keep the tone enthusiastic but accurate — this README is public-facing.

4. Do NOT rewrite sections that didn't change — surgical updates only.
